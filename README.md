## 1: I have created the Login UI
  It just for Good look but only the Skip button works. 

## 2: Clicking Skip button
  we come to the category section, I divided the category in three parts: Mobile, Laptop and Other.

## 3: Every Product in each section is clickable 
  By clicking "View Offer" there is another UI in which the details of the product or offer is shown there.

## 4:(Main Part) Search Button in home screen. 
  Searching the query will give expected results. It is working fine as If anybody gives wrong query then it shows "Data not Found".
